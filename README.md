# BOhoneycomb
This repository contains the Python scripts for the Bayesian shape optimisation of hexagonal honeycomb metamaterial using finite element software Abaqus (Dessault Systemes).

The scripts were developed by Igor Kuszczak (github.com/IgorKuszczak/bayes-opt-for-abaqus) as part of the research work entitled "Bayesian shape optimisation of hexagonal honeycomb metamaterial" by I. Kuszczak, F. I Azam, M.A. Bessa, P.J. Tan, and F. Bosi. The inspiration from this work came from the data-driven design framework for materials and structures by Miguel A. Bessa (github.com/mabessa/F3DAM)
